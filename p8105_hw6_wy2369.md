# Problem 1

# Problem 2

### Read and clean

Create a `city_state` variable and a `homicide_status` (binary) variable
indicating whether the homicide is solved.

Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t
report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ",", state),
    homicide_status =  ifelse(disposition != "Closed by arrest", "unsolved", "solved")) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas,TX" & city_state != "Phoenix,AZ" & city_state !="Kansas City,MO" & city_state != "Tulsa,AL")
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is
white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.
